        <h2> ü¶∫ Projects</h2>
        <h3>Schneider Electric EWS Smart Connector Integration</h3>
        <p>In this project, I was tasked to design and develop C# DLL files for EWS based software in Schneider Electric
            automation systems. The task required managing source code for different types of correlated projects like
            SNMP communication nodes, SQL data storage and retrieval for sensors using ADO.NET, and web apps that
            provided a user interface for the engineer/technician to manage I/Os of the network. I was solely
            responsible for designing, testing, and developing the architecture of the system to be deployed in foreign
            gulf countries.</p>

        <h3>App Development (IONIC) Greenie-Energy</h3>
        <p>This project had a span of 4 months where I needed to design an app that would be used to locate charging
            stations owned by the company. The app also had features such as Razor payment integration, charging
            initiation, exemption, and recharge. I also designed and developed new APIs which communicated using REST
            methods with the application for registering and logging in users. The app is currently available online on
            the App Store as well as the Play Store. However, my terms of contract ended in 2022.</p>

        <h3>Web App Development using Node.js MVC Architecture</h3>
        <p>This project required designing a web app for employees in the company to manage their data. Due to low
            relational conditions prompted during the tasks, I shifted my database from SQL to MongoDB as it provided
            faster performance without the cost of relations. I used Express for my Node.js server and basic REST API
            methods with a few exceptions of SOAP APIs.</p>

        <h3>KIOSK Based Touchscreen App for Linux Systems using Electron.js</h3>
        <p>This project was in correlation to the Schneider Electric systems where I had to design a full app with
            features to control smart home appliances. Initially, I worked on the front end and back end of the
            application using Electron.js and Node.js. Due to my experience and education in electronics, I shifted my
            backend to Python to efficiently code and communicate with smart home systems. I mostly worked with
            communication protocols like MODBUS and SNMP during this project and used SQL databases for data storage.
        </p>

        <h3>App Development Electric Vehicle Charging in Flutter (In Development)</h3>
        <p>This recent project, currently on hold due to backend complications, has the front end of the app ready and
            awaiting further development. I was tasked with translating UI/UX design to Flutter-based widgets and
            handling state management using Riverpod dependency, deciding between stateless and stateful widgets for
            screens and controls. I was responsible for handling the logic of the app, registration using the phone
            number, and QR scanning with automatic light state. I also used Stream and Future builders for WebSocket and
            Web API consumption.</p>

        <h3>Machine Learning Image Classification</h3>
        <p>Multiple and Binary Image Classification using TensorFlow (Research and Development): This ongoing project
            involves creating a model that can detect custom images based on the company's needs. Currently, I am
            researching optimizing my trained .h5 models or .keras models and using them in other programming languages
            like Dart and Node.js. In the future, I plan to use these models for more complex image classification by
            increasing variables in dense layers. For now, I am using basic training and validation dataset images to
            identify efficient model layers for high accurate training, reducing underfitting, and overfitting
            conditions.</p>
